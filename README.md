The aim of the project is to predict fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning models. This is crucial from the bank’s as well as customer’s perspective. The banks cannot afford to lose their customers’ money to fraudsters. Every fraud is a loss to the bank as the bank is responsible for the fraud transactions.

Credit card fraud detection is the process of identifying fraudulent credit card transactions in order to prevent unauthorized charges.

It is an important application of machine learning algorithms. Researchers have used different machine learning methods to detect and analyze frauds in online transactions1. There are many ways to detect credit card fraud such as **rule-based systems, anomaly detection, clustering, decision trees, and neural networks.**

Credit card fraud can happen in many ways. Fraudsters can get your information through lost or stolen credit cards, skimming your credit card at a gas station pump, hacking your computer, or calling about fake prizes or wire.

**And once the details are stolen, it is very easy to do a transaction using that information. Hence, it is necessary to be able to detect these kind of transactions and intervene to prevent fraud.**

Problem statement:
**The aim of the project is to predict fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning models.

This is crucial from the bank’s as well as customer’s perspective.

The banks cannot afford to lose their customers’ money to fraudsters.

Every fraud is a loss to the bank as the bank is responsible for the fraud transactions.

The dataset contains transactions made over a period of two days in September 2013 by European credit cardholders.

The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.

We need to take care of the data imbalance while building the model and come up with the best model by trying various algorithms.**

**Steps:**
The steps are broadly divided into below steps. The sub steps are also listed while we approach each of the steps.

1.Reading, understanding and visualising the data
2.Preparing the data for modelling
3.Building the model
4.Evaluate the model
